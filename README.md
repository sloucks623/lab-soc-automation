## Overview

This lab follows [Myfdirâ€™s SOC Automation tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/@myfdir) to build a workflow that simulates how Security Operations Centers (SOCs) automate alert triage and incident response using open-source tools.

The lab integrates Shuffle (SOAR), Elastic Stack (SIEM), and Slack to create a lightweight, but functional, alert-handling pipeline â€” from log ingestion to analyst notification.
